# Transcendence

> Transcendence refers to the very highest and most inclusive or holistic levels of human consciousness, behaving and relating, as ends rather than means, to oneself, to significant others, to human beings in general, to other species, to nature, and to the cosmos.

Only once all other levels are met can people begin to transcend.

## Data Driven Perspective

FALC is completely transparent in the data it gathers and how it makes decisions. At any time, residents may ask to see their lives from the third-person data driven perspective the AI sees. This may take the form of AI art featuring the resident, or charts and graphs showing job board stats, or something even better.
